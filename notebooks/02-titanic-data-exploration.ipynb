    "Finally, let's make a grid of boxplots to represent the various subsets of our data. This exists in *R's* `ggplot` library, using a `facet_grid` function while constructing the plot. We couldn't find anything like it in *Julia's* various plotting libraries, but we know it can do boxplots, and we know it can do grids of plots, and that's all *R's* facet grid of boxplots is really doing. The JuliaPlots ecosystem provides some macros and recipes for creating more complex plots, and we used that. If you're interested, you can find it in *src/lib/CustomPlots.jl*, but for now, let's just see what we get... "
